&lt;p&gt;My name is Danny Bolella.  I&amp;rsquo;m a Developer/Scrum Master who just wants to do what I love!  And coding just so happens to be one of those things.  For why I&amp;rsquo;ve created this blog, just out &lt;a href=&#34;../../post/2016-09-30-welcome/&#34;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-history&#34;&gt;my history&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I graduated from Stevens Insitute of Technology in 2012 with a B.S. in Computer Science.  While at Stevens, I participated in the Cooperative Education program, which earned me 2 years of full-time work experience across 3 companies.  I graduated not only with everything I learned in the classroom, but also the invaluable lessons and experiences I had working on real projects ranging from private equity tracking, to energey forecasting, to routing systems for oil tankers travelling across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I graduated I worked for 2 and a half years in the asset management part of a major bank.  There, I worked as a full stack developer for a handful of internal products.  Eventually, I joined where I am today as an iOS developer where I worked on the flagship mobile application responsible for millions of dollars in transactions.  My journey here has put me in the middle of a major agile transformation where I&amp;rsquo;ve practicaed pair programming, TDD, setting up and maintaing continuous integration processes, and wokring in sprints.  When the opportunity to take on a more leadership role presented itself, I took it and am now a Scrum Master.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;interests&#34;&gt;interests&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Primarily, I&amp;rsquo;ve really been interested in Swift and node.js these days.  Node because it has so many uses and it&amp;rsquo;s quick and raw to work with.  And Swift because I&amp;rsquo;ve totally immersed my self in the iOS/Apple ecosystem now, but also because I&amp;rsquo;m one of those on the nadwagon who feel that the language is hopeful.  I truly believe it can be a great language that can be fun, elegant, and powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
